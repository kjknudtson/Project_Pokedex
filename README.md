# Project Pokedex

## Description

This was a fun "Pokedex" program I coded, as a way to further practice coding.  It utilizes html, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, and uses an AJAX call of the API, PokeAPI.  I even used some custom Google fonts.  I very much enjoyed Pokemon as a kid in the '90s and I really enjoyed working on this.  This project helped me get an even better understanding of API calls and helped me utilize Google Fonts, as I hadn't used them in a project before, and I really like how they look.  Whilthe it is a functioning program, I still want to see if I can add more to it.

## Use

When the user opens the page, they will see the "Pokedex" with an input at the top.  The user may enter a Pokemon's name (Ex: Bulbasaur) or number (Ex: 1) and click "Search".  Once clicked, the windows will be filled with the selected Pokemon's info (in the case of the examples given, Bulbasaur's info would be shown for both) that the user may scour.  Some of the info shown includes: Name, Typing, Abilities, and Base Stats.

If the user doesn't have a particular Pokemon they would like to see, and instead would like to search random Pokemon, then they can click the "Random" button, which is located to the right of the input form at the top.  Once clicked, the windows are filled with info for a random Pokemon.
